The Mice Protein Expression Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository is used as a classification problem. Two famous classifier KNN and Decision Tree were used. Project conducted in Python. Note that this was done as a requirement for an Assignment in a Python Course. Feedback recieved as the Hypothesis that I came up with needs improvement or are not relevant.
